This is an introductory project for me so it's pretty simple but gave me good experience using VS Code and Python.
It's nothing too special, just a submission for a challenge from the Slothbytes Newsletter.
A class with a function and some tests that takes a number line and finds how many are missing from a linear count.

For the record, feel free to use this if you wish as long as you don't try to pass it off as your own work, I really don't care.
